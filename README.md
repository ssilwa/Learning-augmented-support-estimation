Code for the submission "Learning-based Support Estimation in Sublinear Time." See https://openreview.net/forum?id=tilovEHA3YS

Files:

- code.py: contains implementation of our algorithm
- sample_use.py: contains a sample use case

If you wish to run our algorithm on all of AOL and CIADA data, please get the model inference code and training data as specified here: https://github.com/chenyuhsu/learnedsketch (we use their RNN as our oracle/predictor). Then you can either trian the model as specified there or load the appropriate checkpoints from the folder 'pretrianed'.
